#Problem
We want to graph the average tempo for songs grouped by genre, and sorted by year.

#Questions
1. How do we get the tempo for a song?
2. How do we get the genre for a song?
3. How do we get the year for a song?

#Resources
1. [EchoNest API]
2. 

####Mini-abstract and relevance of the [EchoNest API]
 The [EchoNest API] is the documentation for the module that allows us to extract statistics for a song.
 One of these statistics is the tempo throughout a song.  This allows us to answer Question 1: How do we get the tempo for a song?
