#onesegment.py
This code simply takes the first segment out of every beat.
It then combines all of the segments taken into one audio
file.  This is similar to the [one.py] file in the EchoNest Remix Examples found in the [Remix] repository on GitHub.  However, this file takes the first segment out of every beat, instead of taking the first beat from every bar.  This file is considerably shorter than the original.
