##mylimp
This code simply takes the limp example from EchoNest's examples, and changes it so that
each beat has the last tatum taken out of it.  The original EchoNest example had the last
beat (or group of tatums) taken out of each bar.
##one_segment
This code simply takes each bar and gets the first segment out of each bar in a song.
